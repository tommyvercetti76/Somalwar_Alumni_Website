        <p class="message">Education is a life-long learning process. Learning happens all the time; not only in a
            pre-designated place called the school. It happens at home, between home and school too. The mission of home
            and school mission is to provide a learning environment and opportunities to the children as learners. With
            great pleasure, I welcome you to the Academic year 2020-21 at Somalwar Marathi primary School (Semi
            English). I am very excited to serve all of you in my fourth year as the Principal. At our school, our
            staff, parents, and students take a great deal of pride in offering the highest level of academic classes
            along with the belief that all the students should be involved in and enjoy their e-learning experience at
            the same time. Our staff continues to engage in the review and refinement of our instructional programs with
            “Digital education” to ensure all students are performing at their best levels in the classroom.
            All Credit goes to our school’s management members</p>
